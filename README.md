## About The Project

Sample questions for sailing exam at ANR are available in PDF format.
Project aims to create a dynamic experience on training yourself with the provided questions on their website.

Note: actual data is not added to this git repo here, as I have no intellectual
property on them. Sample data is provided with just a few questions.
